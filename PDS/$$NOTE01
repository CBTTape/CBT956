We are in a project to convert TN3270 access from the standard
telnet unsecured port(s) to secured ports.  As part of this we
needed a way to determine which users had been converted to the
secure ports and those that were still using the unsecured
ports.  I found Steve Meyers program (scan118) on file 956 and
we used it as a starting point.  I made a valiant attempt to
modify this code to add the port number(s) to the output report
but ended up asking a colleague to accomplish this.  He modified
the code and now we can see in the report what ports users are
connecting to.  On a side note IBM recommends using SMF record
type 119 instead of 118 but we didn't have the time or resources
to write that code from scratch.

Fred Camp fred.camp@vericast modified the code.  I am submitting
this with his permission as I feel it may be useful to others.

Attaching the zip file created from the XMI file.

Hope all is well with you.
