               Notes about using ICOPY

1.  ICOPY is a dataset copying program which works by copying
    tracks, using EXCP.  For that reason, you can copy a pds
    without specifying the SPACE requirements for the directory
    in the JCL.  Since ICOPY duplicates the track contents of
    the original dataset, it will copy the directory block
    structure, as well, without any user intervention.

    All you need to specify in the JCL, is the SPACE requirement
    for the output dataset.  You don't need to specify the number
    of directory blocks in the JCL, for an output pds.

2.  VERY IMPORTANTLY, WHEN COPYING A PARTITIONED DATASET WITH
    ICOPY, ALL DELETED MEMBERS ARE PRESERVED.  This is because
    ICOPY is a "track copying program", as opposed to IEBCOPY,
    which is a "member copying program".

2.  ICOPY will not copy DSORG=DA datasets.

3.  ICOPY will not copy PDSE's.

4.  ICOPY is very handy when trying to duplicate a non-VSAM dataset,
    and you don't know the DCB specs, just the size.  You can make
    a copy of some large pds like SYS1.LINKLIB in a jiffy, using this
    utility.

5.  ICOPY needs to be linked together with the MINIFMT program.
    For an example of the ASM-LINK JCL, see member ICOPY$.
    For an example of the run JCL, see member ICOPYJ1.
