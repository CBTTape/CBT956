Update to program SCAN118 File 956 from Steve Myers to include port numbers.
Our company is migrating from the standard telnet port to use secure TN3270
ports.  The original code reported on sessions, userids, times and IP
addresses.  We needed the capability to see who is using the old un-secured
ports as well as the secured ports to determine who still needed to be
migrated.  I asked our assembler guru to see if he could modify the code to
accomplish that and he did.
